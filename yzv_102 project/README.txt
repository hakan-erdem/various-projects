The rules of the typing tests:

- Once you start the test, you will write the text sentence by sentence.
- If you press enter without finishing the sentence, the rest of the words and chars will be counted as wrong written.
- If you pass or write an extra word while typing, the rest of the words and chars will be counted as wrong written.
- Adjusted words per minute is your correct written words per minute value.
- Adjusted wpm is the most important stat for the user, because the leaderboard is according to the adjusted wpm.
- There are 3 different levels of typing tests.
